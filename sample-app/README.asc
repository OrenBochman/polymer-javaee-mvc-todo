= polymer-javaee-mvc-todo


Sample application showing how to use https://polymer-project.org[Polymer^] with http://mvc-spec.org/[Java EE MVC 1.0^] and https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339[JAX-RS^].

Originally presented at JavaOne 2015 (and presented again in subsequent years) by Kito D. Mann, http://www.virtua.com[Virtua, Inc.^]

This app has been tested only with a specific version of Ozark (see `build.gradle`) and https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/download[Glasshfish 4.1^].

NOTE: The ``build.gradle`` file includes the dependencies, but hasn't yet been tested for creating a full WAR (IntelliJ was used for the initial build).
